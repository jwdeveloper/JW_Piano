    <text>A Minecraft plugin that adds a playable piano to the game would allow players to interact with a piano in the
        game world.
    </text>
    <text>This piano would function just like a real-life piano, allowing players to play individual notes or full
        melodies using their real keyboard with Desktop app connection.
    </text>
    <text>The plugin would add a new level of creativity and musical expression to the game, allowing players to
        showcase their musical talents and compose their own tunes.
    </text>
    <text>Additionally, the piano could be used as a decorative item in the game world, adding a new element of realism
        and immersion to the game.
    </text>
    <text>Overall, this plugin would be a fun and unique addition to Minecraft, providing players with a new way to
        interact with the game world and express themselves.
